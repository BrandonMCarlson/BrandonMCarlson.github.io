        <p class="card-text">My name is Brandon Carlson and I am a 28 year old father to 3 kids. 
          I am married to my beautiful wife named Kendra. My 3 kids are Kayden who is the oldest, Maison who is the middle child, and Scarlett who is the baby of the family. 
          Before I was able to have the amazing family that I have today, I served in the Navy for 6 years. 
          During this time I learned a lot about computers and getting programs up and running from nothing. 
          This allowed me the opportunity to do some very minimal coding to ensure proper tracking of hours/times flown. 
          After I left the Navy in 2019 I moved to Spokane, WA where I attended an EMT program. 
          I completed this program and when on to work in the city of Spokane with AMR. 
          This was an amazing time for myself as I got to experience many different emergencies and also got to meet a bunch of veterans in the field and make some good friends.
          I will have to say the most rewarding thing I got to do in EMS was deliver a healthy baby boy in the back of my ambulance, it was a surreal experience and one I will never forget. 
          I then left the EMS world as it was not a job I wanted to continue doing for many years to come. 
          I wanted a job and career field that would challenge me on a daily basis, and also one that allowed me to be home more with my kids. 
          This led me into taking college courses to go for my Associate in Computer Science. I attempted this for 6 months when I realized that it was not the way for me to learn. 
          I happened to stumble across devCodeCamp when searching for a program related to coding and the GI Bill. 
          After this course is finished I plan to jump right into a job and continue to better myself on the coding front. </p>
